## Summary: Prototyping Purpose & Process

## Tasks Supported by the System

1) Retrieve simple information from UCLA Library homepage. 
2) Implement easy header shortcuts using drop-down menus for the "News & Events" and the "Locations" pages.
3) Simplifying the "Events" page and allowing automatic RSVP.
4) Simple navigation between library pages to explore features, amenities, and collections.
5) Added feature for each individual library page to include their "Least Crowded Time."

## GUI Decision Making

While the colors may seem like an odd mixture to users outside of the UCLA community, the decisions I used to design my GUI were quite consistent throughout. 
1. _Color_ -- This is inevitably a very important part of the visual design experience as it draws the user in automatically and contributes greatly to the presentability of design. Perhaps, it is one of the most important components as it initiates the first impression of the website or application. In my particular case, I decided to use a total of about 5 colors - Blue, Gold, Black, Gray, and White. The reason I chose these colors was primarily to mix the branded UCLA colors with their specific Hex values with simple colors like Black, Gray, and White (which were better fit for body text and more subtle buttons).
2. _Typography_ -- I decided to choose a font that was relatively similar to UCLA's general font since I couldn't find that original one. As a result, I chose this font in order to demonstrate professionalism. In addition, I felt like this particular font was readable and also legible, which met my general guidelines for typography. Lastly, ensured that it was consistent throughout in order to alleviate any sort of differences that could arise from changing the appearance of multiple screens.
