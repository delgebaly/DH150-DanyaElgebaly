## Scenarios + Journey Maps

### Scenario #1:Lauren's Scenario
- Lauren is a 2nd year undergraduate at UCLA pursuing a bachelor's of arts in Public Affairs. She cares a lot about human rights in general, specifically womens' rights and the development of feminism. Lauren is looking to get involved in research on campus and wants to learn more about how she can get started in finding relevant sources to propose to a professor to find guidance. She's thinking about what sorts of resources might be relevant to helping her conduct her research and so, she refers to the UCLA library website to learn more. 
- When Lauren visits the website, immediately she finds that the homepage says "Start your remote research" with a search bar for books, articles, databases, journals, and more. She feels tempted to do a search, but she actually has no idea how to conduct research or what her topic might be based on. She navigates her mouse to the header at the top of the page and clicks on "Research & Teaching Assistance" because it seems relevant. When she clicks on it, she is overwhelmed by so many links on the page, so she scrolls back to the header and clicks on the "News and Events" page as she feels like she needs to attend a workshop first. She finds some of the upcoming workshops in the near future, but is frustrated that they do not list the times or brief descriptions immediately. As a result, she clicks on each one that is interesting, reads about it, checks her calendar for conflicts and finally ends up RSVP-ing to one.
