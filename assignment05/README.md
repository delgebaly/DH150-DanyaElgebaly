## Scenarios + Journey Maps

### Scenario #1:Lauren's Scenario
- Lauren is a 2nd year undergraduate at UCLA pursuing a bachelor's of arts in Public Affairs. She cares a lot about human rights in general, specifically womens' rights and the development of feminism. Lauren is looking to get involved in research on campus and wants to learn more about how she can get started in finding relevant sources to propose to a professor to find guidance. She's thinking about what sorts of resources might be relevant to helping her conduct her research and so, she refers to the UCLA library website to learn more. 
- When Lauren visits the website, immediately she finds that the homepage says "Start your remote research" with a search bar for books, articles, databases, journals, and more. She feels tempted to do a search, but she actually has no idea how to conduct research or what her topic might be based on. She navigates her mouse to the header at the top of the page and clicks on "Research & Teaching Assistance" because it seems relevant. When she clicks on it, she is overwhelmed by so many links on the page, so she scrolls back to the header and clicks on the "News and Events" page as she feels like she needs to attend a workshop first. She finds some of the upcoming workshops in the near future, but is frustrated that they do not list the times or brief descriptions immediately. As a result, she clicks on each one that is interesting, reads about it, checks her calendar for conflicts and finally ends up RSVP-ing to one. 


### Scenario #2: Thomas' Scenario
- Thomas is a 3rd year undergraduate at UCLA pursuing a bachelor's of applied science in Computer Science. Thomas spends a lot of his time studying, working on his projects, and hanging out with his fellow classmates. He definitely considers himself a night person and spends lots of his time at night working, rather than the morning. Thomas finds himself always trying to find places to study where the hours both fit his needs and provide some sort of collaborative space, particularly when he's working with a group or studying with other people. One day during week 5 of spring quarter, Thomas is having dinner in the dining hall and decides to go back to campus to work for the rest of the night, starting at 7 o'clock. So, he pulls out his phone and checks the UCLA Library website for the library's working hours. 
- He navigates to the UCLA Library website where the homepage is all about conducting research. He thinks this is strange and that the library hours would be listed immediately, but he doesn't question it. He navigates to the header at the top of the page and goes to locations. He narrows his search by filtering it using "open now" and checking off "collaboration pods", "conversation allowed", and "group study room." He finally chooses a spot to go, but then clicks on it and realizes it closes at 8 pm, which would give him under an hour to study. As a result, he navigates through multiple library pages to find out which one opens the latest. He wishes that the filtering options had more flexibility to choose a spot that opens late. 

### Scenario #3: Kiara's Scenario
- Kiara is a potential prospective student at UCLA, who is thoroughly conducting extensive research on all of the universities she was accepted to before making a final decision on the school where she will spend the next four years of her life. Kiara is very specifically interested in UCLA because of its extensive life science programs, so she has been looking into lots regarding what UCLA has to offer. She also just enjoys reading simple information about the school, so she decided that it would be useful to visit the UCLA library website to find some more information about educational resources and some history about the library.
- Kiara takes out her laptop and visits the website. The first thing she notices is that the homepage does not provide a welcome page, or contain any information about the website itself. She does, however, notice that there is a lot of information on the home page which is helpful in giving her a glimpse of the resources that are offered. These include some overviews of events, news, resources like group study rooms, laptop lending, etc. After searching through the page a little more and looking through the header, she does not seem to find any about page. When she scrolls all the way down, she finds an about the library page where she clicks. This redirects her to a site with a nice overview of the libraries and some quick facts. While she finds the information she needs, she thinks its kind of odd why this link was very hidden at the bottom of the page.
