        <main> The UCLA Library website serves a resource to inform students on library hours, resources, research, navigation, and various other important information. The main issues that I found when visiting the UCLA library website was primarily the ease of navigation and accessibilty of resources. With so much information being presented on the screen, things often get cluttered and it becomes difficult to find exactly what you're looking for. Through simple improvements of the user interface, information and data cleaning, as well as re-organization and re-structuring of certain keywords and phrases, the website can improve its quality of user experience.

             The UCLA Library website is a crucial resource for current and prospective students, faculty, and staff at UCLA. It shares resources regarding various library features, locations, hours operation, as well as technical workshops, research guides, campus news, and so much more. It serves as a crucial access point to lots of useful educational information that is open to the public.

            Upon conducting a heuristic evaluation for the UCLA Library, I found many issues related to information overload and ambiguity that might hinder usability of the technology. The main issues I came across fell under three main heuristics. The first issue was information overload and difficulty of finding information, through the "Visibility of System Status" heuristic. The second issue regarding finding information that is easy to navigate through fell short of the "Flexibility and Efficiency of Use" heuristic. The final issue that seemed to arise throughout the site was language ambiguity which fell under "Consistency and Standards."

            As a result, I put these three heuristics to the test by conducting a usability test to investigate these usability issues through three simple tasks. The purpose of this usability test is to evaluate how individuals are using the applicaton/website and better understand how functionality of various technology can be improved through their perspective.

           1) Task #1 was to simply navigate through the News & Events page, find simple information regarding content, date, location, and time, and RSVP if any seem interesting.
           2) Task #2 instructed the participant to imagine that they were in a rush before class and needed to find a color printer to print their assignment. They were told to navigate through the libraries and find one that would be suitable to print their assignment.
           3) Task #3 finally asked the participant to navigate through various research guides, find one about Government Information and find the definition of the word "Federal" from this guide. These tasks should illuminate some of the heuristic issues that arose during my evaluation, particularly Visibility of System Status, Flexibility and Efficiency of Use, and Consistency and Standards, respectively.

- What is the main activity your project would support the users?
The main activity my project would support for its users are to search and find information effectively and efficiently. Because the UCLA Library essentially serves as a resource for students, the main activity its used for is to find necessary content about library-related events, resources, and relevant facts and information rather than purely research related content.

- What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
This activity serves the need of filling in content gaps, or providing relevant answers to questions users may have. In particular, needs may include searching for information such as relevant upcoming workshops and events, library hours, features of libraries and more.

- What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The current solution for these needs are to present this information in a variety of pages on the UCLA Library website. Most of these pages will link to external sites or other shortcuts, which will then provide you with this information.

- What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
The primary limitation that can be improved with digital technology and potential re-design is the organization of information and the value of categorization. Because there is an information overload on the website, content is scattered all over the place and ambiguity of the site does not allow for effective user search, thus making it a much longer process to find information.

Purpose of UX Storytelling
The main purpose of UX storytelling is to step out and gain a broader perspective of your users, their thoughts, actions, and frustrations with the technology you are evaluating. It allows you to develop characters as representations of your target market and truly delve into their characters and intentions in order to effectively evaluate their thinking process and their actions with respect to the technology. This is useful for design as it allows designers and researchers to better understand why they are pursuing a re-design and what the exact purpose of this may serve, specifically how it is impactful.

The focus of this project is to address the main design and usability issues associated with the online UCLA Library website. The purpose of the website is to provide students, faculty, staff and all members of the UCLA community with useful information regarding research as well as contextual information relevant to the library. The library itself has many useful resources to present including events, workshops, libriarians, tech support and so much more. With the presence of all of this information, it is often very easy to get lost within the site and lose focus of your original intention or perhaps, even fail to find what you're looking for.

After conducting various user research and usability test, I realized that the biggest difficulties associated with the UCLA Library website are the information overload and the difficulty of finding information. By simply implementing additional features and some information re-organization through the use of a low-fidelity prototype, we can better understand the users' needs and how this may benefit them in the case of a website re-design. As a result, my personas are representatative of individuals who would typically be users of the UCLA Library website and would conduct simple tasks that currently have design issues, which would be addressed through prototyping.

The personas that I chose to represent my users for this particular project are three different individuals all relevant to UCLA. The first one is Lauren, a 2nd year undergraduate at UCLA who is trying to get involved in research and frequently goes to the Library website to check out what kinds of workshops and events are being held to help her gain better insights as to what she could pursue. Thomas is a 3rd year at UCLA who spends a lot of time at the Library, particularly during late hours and wants an easy way to find the perfect library for him to study at, which opens late and offers collaboration pods. Lastly, Kiara is a potential UCLA student who just conducts research about universities by going through their websites. She is considering attending UCLA, but wants to learn more about the facilities online.
