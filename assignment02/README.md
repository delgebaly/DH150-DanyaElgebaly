## Pilot Usability Test

### Introduction 

The UCLA Library website is a crucial resource for current and prospective students, faculty, and staff at UCLA. It shares resources regarding various library features, locations, hours operation, as well as technical workshops, research guides, campus news, and so much more. It serves as a crucial access point to lots of useful educational information that is open to the public. 

Upon conducting a heuristic evaluation for the UCLA Library, I found many issues related to information overload and ambiguity that might hinder usability of the technology. The main issues I came across fell under three main heuristics. The first issue was information overload and difficulty of finding information, through the "Visibility of System Status" heuristic. The second issue regarding finding information that is easy to navigate through fell short of the "Flexibility and Efficiency of Use" heuristic. The final issue that seemed to arise throughout the site was language ambiguity which fell under "Consistency and Standards."

As a result, I put these three heuristics to the test by conducting a usability test to investigate these usability issues through three simple tasks. The purpose of this usability test is to evaluate how individuals are using the applicaton/website and better understand how functionality of various technology can be improved through their perspective. 
- Task #1 was to simply navigate through the News & Events page, find simple information regarding content, date, location, and time, and RSVP if any seem interesting.
- Task #2 instructed the participant to imagine that they were in a rush before class and needed to find a color printer to print their assignment. They were told to navigate through the libraries and find one that would be suitable to print their assignment. 
- Task #3 finally asked the participant to navigate through various research guides, find one about Government Information and find the definition of the word "Federal" from this guide.
These tasks should illuminate some of the heuristic issues that arose during my evaluation, particularly Visibility of System Status, Flexibility and Efficiency of Use, and Consistency and Standards, respectively.
