# Low-fidelity Prototype

## Project Description

The focus of this project is to address the main design and usability issues associated with the online UCLA Library website. The purpose of the website is to provide students, faculty, staff and all members of the UCLA community with useful information regarding research as well as contextual information relevant to the library. The library itself has many useful resources to present including events, workshops, libriarians, tech support and so much more. With the presence of all of this information, it is often very easy to get lost within the site and lose focus of your original intention or perhaps, even fail to find what you're looking for. 

After conducting various user research and usability test, I realized that the biggest difficulties associated with the UCLA Library website are the information overload and the difficulty of finding information. By simply implementing additional features and some information re-organization through the use of a low-fidelity prototype, we can better understand the users' needs and how this may benefit them in the case of a website re-design. As a result, my personas are representatative of individuals who would typically be users of the UCLA Library website and would conduct simple tasks that currently have design issues, which would be addressed through prototyping. 

The personas that I chose to represent my users for this particular project are three different individuals all relevant to UCLA. The first one is Lauren, a 2nd year undergraduate at UCLA who is trying to get involved in research and frequently goes to the Library website to check out what kinds of workshops and events are being held to help her gain better insights as to what she could pursue. Thomas is a 3rd year at UCLA who spends a lot of time at the Library, particularly during late hours and wants an easy way to find the perfect library for him to study at, which opens late and offers collaboration pods. Lastly, Kiara is a potential UCLA student who just conducts research about universities by going through their websites. She is considering attending UCLA, but wants to learn more about the facilities online. 


## Tasks

### 1) Retrieve information easily through _UCLA Library homepage_
- Homepage reorganization, condensing information, and overcoming information overload
### 2) Implementing _Header Shortcuts_
- Simplifying user navigation process by conveying information more appropriately
### 3) Simple information gathering from _News & Events Page_
- Including less links and more relevant information on the page itself
- Allowing visitors to RSVP on the spot
