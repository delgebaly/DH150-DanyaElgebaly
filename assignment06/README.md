# Low-fidelity Prototype

## Project Description

The focus of this project is to address the main design and usability issues associated with the online UCLA Library website. The purpose of the website is to provide students, faculty, staff and all members of the UCLA community with useful information regarding research as well as contextual information relevant to the library. The library itself has many useful resources to present including events, workshops, libriarians, tech support and so much more. With the presence of all of this information, it is often very easy to get lost within the site and lose focus of your original intention or perhaps, even fail to find what you're looking for. 

After conducting various user research and usability test, I realized that the biggest difficulties associated with the UCLA Library website are the information overload and the difficulty of finding information. By simply implementing additional features and some information re-organization through the use of a low-fidelity prototype, we can better understand the users' needs and how this may benefit them in the case of a website re-design. As a result, my personas are representatative of individuals who would typically be users of the UCLA Library website and would conduct simple tasks that currently have design issues, which would be addressed through prototyping. 

The personas that I chose to represent my users for this particular project are three different individuals all relevant to UCLA. The first one is Lauren, a 2nd year undergraduate at UCLA who is trying to get involved in research and frequently goes to the Library website to check out what kinds of workshops and events are being held to help her gain better insights as to what she could pursue. Thomas is a 3rd year at UCLA who spends a lot of time at the Library, particularly during late hours and wants an easy way to find the perfect library for him to study at, which opens late and offers collaboration pods. Lastly, Kiara is a potential UCLA student who just conducts research about universities by going through their websites. She is considering attending UCLA, but wants to learn more about the facilities online. 


## Tasks

### 1) Retrieve information easily through _UCLA Library homepage_
- Homepage reorganization, condensing information, and overcoming information overload
### 2) Implementing _Header Shortcuts_
- Simplifying user navigation process by conveying information more appropriately
### 3) Simple information gathering from _News & Events Page_
- Including less links and more relevant information on the page itself
- Allowing visitors to RSVP on the spot

## Prototypes

## Feedback + Reflection

This experience was very useful as it highlighted some issues that arose from my lo-fidelity prototyping process. Many of these were just simple buttons that may have been missing from the interface and more often than not, it seemed as though my physical prototype had difficulties presenting intentions to the user. Although it made it more difficult for the user, it allowed them to think out loud and ask some questions which are documented on the user flows. One of these primary intention issues arose from understanding whether or not a button represented a hyperlink or whether certain buttons could be hovered over in order to bring about drop down menus. Although these were simple issues, they could have been documented better in the prototype itself. However, I now know better and will take it into account in the high-fidelity model.

Overall, the process was very interesting. I think low-fidelity prototyping is very useful in gathering ideas and documenting it straight away on paper, but it does become difficult to be very clear and concise with every button and feature as designers will have to go through multiple iterations of the prototype to get it right. More specifically, gathering these thoughts and designs on pen and paper are valuable as they allow you get a nice image of what you're looking for and then later, refine it through high-fidelity models. Based on the feedback I got from prototype testing, I would use icons and symbols that were better representative of the information behind it and I would generally be more conscious of user freedom in order to allow users to freely navigate pages with no trouble.
