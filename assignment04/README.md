## Users in Context

### Step 01: Specify the Main Design Challenge
#### - What is the main activity your project would support the users?
The main activity my project would support for its users are to search and find information effectively and efficiently. Because the UCLA Library essentially serves as a resource for students, the main activity its used for is to find necessary content about library-related events, resources, and relevant facts and information.

#### - What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
This activity serves the need of filling in content gaps, or providing relevant answers to questions users may have. In particular, needs may include searching for information such as relevant upcoming workshops and events, library hours, features of libraries and more.

#### - What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The current solution for these needs are to present this information in a variety of pages on the UCLA Library website. Most of these pages will link to external sites or other shortcuts, which will then provide you with this information. 

#### - What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
The primary limitation that can be improved with digital technology and potential re-design is the organization of information and the value of categorization. Because there is an information overload on the website, content is scattered all over the place and ambiguity of the site does not allow for effective user search, thus making it a much longer process to find information.

### Step 02: Target Users
#### - What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Demographic: UCLA campus community including students and faculty who use the UCLA Library and may refer to the website for certain information
Preference: Students who go to the library more than other non-traditional study spaces and turn to the library for resources when needed
Expertise: Users should be able to understand how to access the web, but no specific technical expertise is required for website navigation


#### - Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)



#### - What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)

### Step 03: Pick Research Methods
#### Interview with direct / passive / participatory observation.
#### Or something you learned on your own (refer to the field guideline by IDEO)
