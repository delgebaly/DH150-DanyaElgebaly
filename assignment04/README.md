# Users in Context

## Step 01: Specify the Main Design Challenge
### - What is the main activity your project would support the users?
The main activity my project would support for its users are to search and find information effectively and efficiently. Because the UCLA Library essentially serves as a resource for students, the main activity its used for is to find necessary content about library-related events, resources, and relevant facts and information rather than purely research related content.

### - What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
This activity serves the need of filling in content gaps, or providing relevant answers to questions users may have. In particular, needs may include searching for information such as relevant upcoming workshops and events, library hours, features of libraries and more.

### - What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The current solution for these needs are to present this information in a variety of pages on the UCLA Library website. Most of these pages will link to external sites or other shortcuts, which will then provide you with this information. 

### - What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
The primary limitation that can be improved with digital technology and potential re-design is the organization of information and the value of categorization. Because there is an information overload on the website, content is scattered all over the place and ambiguity of the site does not allow for effective user search, thus making it a much longer process to find information.

## Step 02: Target Users
### - What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Demographic: UCLA campus community including students and faculty who use the UCLA Library and may refer to the website for certain information
Preference: Students who go to the library more than other non-traditional study spaces and turn to the library for resources when needed
Expertise: Users should be able to understand how to access the web, but no specific technical expertise is required for website navigation


### - Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users would most likely do this activity when they are on campus at UCLA and in need of certain information that is relevant to them in that moment. More specifically, the activity involves the search of information. Contexts could include students attempting to print papers on their way to class, trying to find out how to temporarily check out a laptop from the library, or simply to find out which library is open. Under all these circumstances, these are simple information-seeking tasks that users will go through on campus during their classes and study breaks. 

### - What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)

To complete the activity, users would either go to the library specifically and ask someone for information, they could potentially call one of the libraries on campus to find out this information, or they could refer to the UCLA Library website and search for the information they need. 

## Step 03: Pick Research Methods
