# Users in Context

## Step 01: Specify the Main Design Challenge
### - What is the main activity your project would support the users?
The main activity my project would support for its users are to search and find information effectively and efficiently. Because the UCLA Library essentially serves as a resource for students, the main activity its used for is to find necessary content about library-related events, resources, and relevant facts and information rather than purely research related content.

### - What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
This activity serves the need of filling in content gaps, or providing relevant answers to questions users may have. In particular, needs may include searching for information such as relevant upcoming workshops and events, library hours, features of libraries and more.

### - What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The current solution for these needs are to present this information in a variety of pages on the UCLA Library website. Most of these pages will link to external sites or other shortcuts, which will then provide you with this information. 

### - What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
The primary limitation that can be improved with digital technology and potential re-design is the organization of information and the value of categorization. Because there is an information overload on the website, content is scattered all over the place and ambiguity of the site does not allow for effective user search, thus making it a much longer process to find information.

## Step 02: Target Users
### - What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Demographic: UCLA campus community including students and faculty who use the UCLA Library and may refer to the website for certain information
Preference: Students who go to the library more than other non-traditional study spaces and turn to the library for resources when needed
Expertise: Users should be able to understand how to access the web, but no specific technical expertise is required for website navigation


### - Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users would most likely do this activity when they are on campus at UCLA and in need of certain information that is relevant to them in that moment. More specifically, the activity involves the search of information. Contexts could include students attempting to print papers on their way to class, trying to find out how to temporarily check out a laptop from the library, or simply to find out which library is open. Under all these circumstances, these are simple information-seeking tasks that users will go through on campus during their classes and study breaks. 

### - What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)

To complete the activity, users would either go to the library specifically and ask someone for information, they could potentially call one of the libraries on campus to find out this information, or they could refer to the UCLA Library website and search for the information they need. 

## Step 03: Pick Research Methods
The main observation method I used for this task was direct participatory observation. I feel like this was the best way to truly understand the user's purpose and how they felt while going about the activity. In addition to asking them valuable questions regarding their motivations, it's valuable to hear them think out loud and sort of categorize their thoughts based on how the information could be better organized. In an ideal situation, I would definitely conduct field research with UCLA students in particular, but due to my current (quarantined) situation, I had to conduct this research with a parent who is not the typical user. As a result, direct participatory observation seems like the best approach for someone who isn't necessarily familiar with this website.


## Step04: Interview & Materials
### Contextual Inquiry Guide
Please find my script for the interview attached [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnQB_YrDT-J4f2HIs7ltb9Ga0IHI5kiN1zfpip-U0zM/edit?usp=sharing). 

### Interview Data
Please find the video recording of the interivew attached here.
(Note: I had memory issues with my laptop and had to separate the interview into two parts, so it cuts in the middle.)
Please find the transcription attached here. 

### Interview Insights 
- Interviewee mentions the value of clean, simple design during information searching.
- Interviewee completes task and does not necessarily have difficulty completing it, but believes that information could be organized better hierarchically. 
- Interviewee mentions the Wikipedia model as good for finding straightforward information under a time constraint.
- Interviewee prioritizes time efficiency over all other characteristics in completing a search task.
- Interviewee believes that website should have concrete information, be easy to find, and have pages that effectively communicate what they are presenting.

## Reflection
I enjoyed the interview process because I feel like it was much more free flowing and allowed me to gain insights from multiple perspectives. Interestingly enough, while I followed my interview script, I found myself steering away from it a little bit more to adhere to the casual tone of the interview, more of as a conversation than anything else. I gained a lot of good insights from my interviewee as well as for myself as an interviewer. The interviewee highlighted some of the most important parts of information searching as time-efficient, easy, and simple and really stressed the concept of clean and simple design throughout the course of the interview. As for myself, as an interviewer, I discovered that it would be helpful to broadedn my questions a little bit more and diversify them because I worried that the interviewee felt like they were repeating themselves. I also found it quite difficult to remain completely unbiased throughout the course of the interview, but tried to stick to the script. Nonetheless, I do feel like interviews are much less limiting than usability test because they allow interviewees to fully express their thoughts without any sort of constraints by question.
