# Application Re-Design Heuristic Evaluation

## DH150 Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation by Danya Elgebaly

story line

## UCLA Library Website

Brief evaluation/issues you found

## 1. Visibility of System Status

Evaluation:
- _Severity Rating: 2 _ 
- When visiting the home page, the user is immediately re-directed to a page focused on conducting research and accessing the library catalog. Although there is plenty of information about the library throughout the buttons in the header, the homepage is cluttered with research advice, news, events, hours, and resources. While users are aware of how the system is operating and what information is presented, the primary issue lies in finding that information and condensing content, where possible.

## 2. Match Between System and the Real World
Evaluation:
- _Severity Rating: 2 _ 

## 3. User Control and Freedom
Evaluation:
- _Severity Rating: 2_
- One issue that seems to arise from the homepage is that it re-directs you to the library catalog in order to carry out your search. From there, there are no shortcuts that allow you to access other catalogs for articles, journals, databases, and more. As a result, you must return to the main site, click on the type of medium you want to search for, and re-do your search in order to retrieve the results you want. If a user uses the library website for research purposes, this is important as it helps simplify the complexity an frustration of the search process.

No shortcuts to return from catalog to search for different types of sources


## 4. Consistency and Standards
Evaluation:
- _Severity Rating: 3_
- A large issue that seems to arise throughout the website is the meaning of "search" vs. "research". We have discussed how the homepage seems to highlight research as the primary focus. However, the icon in the header next to the home button is a "search" page. This is ambiguous as the user is left to wonder whether this entails searching the library catalog or the resources available or potentially, something else. In addition, on the header bar above that, there is another search bar titled "Site Search". While these all might mean the same thing on a conceptual level, there should be a better way to communicate what exacty the user is searching for.

## 5. Error Prevention

## 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall


## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
- _Severity Rating: 3_
- The primary issue that seems to arise with respect to flexibility is the lack of simple shortcuts. When visiting the UCLA Library webpage, there is a high probability that users will want to navigate through information about specific libraries such as location, hours, amenities, etc. As a result, it becomes increasingly difficult to do so when all the names are just listed on one page, making the user scroll through multiple pages on the "locations" page to find the libraries they are searching for. A potential fix for more experienced users is to simply implement a drop down menu when hovering over the locations button. This would allow users to simply click on one of the locations to be redirected to that particular page. Attached is a screenshot of the bottom of the first page of locations.



## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

- Busy, boxy design

## 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors


## 10. Help and Documentation

- No immediate help documentation, ask a librarian
