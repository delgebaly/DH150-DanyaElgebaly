# Application Re-Design Heuristic Evaluation

## DH150 Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation by Danya Elgebaly

story line

## UCLA Library Website

Brief evaluation/issues you found

## 1. Visibility of System Status

Evaluation:
- When visiting the home page, the user is immediately re-directed to a page focused on conducting research and accessing the library catalog. Although there is plenty of information about the library throughout the buttons in the header, the homepage is cluttered with research advice, news, events, hours, and resources. While users are aware of how the system is operating and what information is presented, the primary issue lies in finding that information and condensing content, where possible. 
- _Severity Rating:_

## 2. Match Between System and the Real World

## 3. User Control and Freedom

No shortcuts to return from catalog to search for different types of sources


## 4. Consistency and Standards

Research vs. search
Search vs. search bar at the top

## 5. Error Prevention

## 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall


## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use


## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

- Busy, boxy design

## 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors


## 10. Help and Documentation
