# Navigating UCLA Library - Danya Elgebaly

## Introduction & Motivations
In this project, I will analyze and re-structure the design of the UCLA Library website to enhance the usability experience and thus, improve the search and navigation process. UCLA Library has plenty of resources to offer, both online and offline. Its website is, perhaps, the most valuable tool it has to present all of its information. However, because of its influx of resources and lack of efficient categorization, it becomes increasingly difficult for user to find what they need in a simple, and efficient time. As a result, I have conducted a full research process including analyzing usability heuristics, user research, storytelling, prototyping, and evaluating the product in order to better solve these issues. 


## Design Statement
Often times, we adhere to searching certain websites for specialized information in order to gain knowledge quickly and efficiently. Upon heavy use of the UCLA Library website during the online learning experience that came about during the COVID-19 pandemic, I started to grasp the concept of _information overload_ and frustrations that may arise from simpe website inefficiencies and cluttered content. With the increasing use of technology and the internet, it is important to be able to find information efficiently and without heavy load on the user. As a result, these issues have been proven useful to analyze and thus, address through the UX life cycle. 


## Competitor Analysis


## User Research
In order to better grasp how users are interacting with the UCLA Library website what specific issues arise, I conducted both pilot usability tests and contextual inquiries. The usability tests allowed me to evaluate how users are specifically interacting with the website and provided me with valuable data that can be analyzed to further refine my research problem. Later, when conducting the contextual inquiry, I was able to gather important information regarding the usability values that the user holds and how they would like to see them addressed.
