# Navigating UCLA Library - Danya Elgebaly

## Introduction & Motivations
In this project, I will analyze and re-structure the design of the UCLA Library website to enhance the usability experience and thus, improve the search and navigation process. UCLA Library has plenty of resources to offer, both online and offline. Its website is, perhaps, the most valuable tool it has to present all of its information. However, because of its influx of resources and lack of efficient categorization, it becomes increasingly difficult for user to find what they need in a simple, and efficient time. As a result, I have conducted a full research process including analyzing usability heuristics, user research, storytelling, prototyping, and evaluating the product in order to better solve these issues.

## Design Statement
Often times, we adhere to searching certain websites for specialized information in order to gain knowledge quickly and efficiently. Upon heavy use of the UCLA Library website during the online learning experience that came about during the COVID-19 pandemic, I started to grasp the concept of _information overload_ and frustrations that may arise from simpe website inefficiencies and cluttered content. With the increasing use of technology and the internet, it is important to be able to find information efficiently and without heavy load on the user. As a result, these issues have been proven useful to analyze and thus, address through the UX life cycle.

## User Research
In order to better grasp how users are interacting with the UCLA Library website what specific issues arise, I conducted both pilot usability tests and contextual inquiries. The usability tests allowed me to evaluate how users are specifically interacting with the website and provided me with valuable data that can be analyzed to further refine my research problem. Later, when conducting the contextual inquiry, I was able to gather important information regarding the usability values that the user holds and how they would like to see them addressed.

## UX Storytelling
One significant part of the UX process is understanding your users and creating personas, fictional represenations of your potential users and their storyline in order to better holistically humanize and value the user-centered element of the design process. 

The personas that I chose to represent my users for this particular project are three different individuals all relevant to UCLA. Here is a brief overview of my three personas: 

- The first one is Lauren, a 2nd year undergraduate at UCLA who is trying to get involved in research and frequently goes to the Library website to check out what kinds of workshops and events are being held to help her gain better insights as to what she could pursue.

- Thomas is a 3rd year at UCLA who spends a lot of time at the Library, particularly during late hours and wants an easy way to find the perfect library for him to study at, which opens late and offers collaboration pods.

- Lastly, Kiara is a potential UCLA student who just conducts research about universities by going through their websites. She is considering attending UCLA, but wants to learn more about the facilities online.

## Wireframing & Graphic Design

## Low-Fidelity Prototype
The purpose of my low-fidelity prototype is to document simple features that I want to implement/adjust as well as further examine the flow between certain interactions as well as gain effective feedback based on these. This also allowed me to bring together my imaginary thoughts on the user interface to a blank document and further develop my design ideas on paper. While my low-fidelity prototype was quite different than my high-fidelity prototype, the feedback I received exposed some of the issues that I had initially overlooked, as its purpose analyzed interactions over visual features. Here are a couple of my wireframes and their respective wireflows:

## High-Fidelity Prototype
My high-fidelity prototype was created on Figma, which helped encompass a greater portion of the design process. During this process, I emphasized the visual design aspect by maintaining UCLA's brand identity while also exploring the usability principles that I have analyzed by designing for three main tasks. These tasks have been evaluated to adhere to the needs of Lauren, Thomas, and Kiara:
1) Retrieving and Simplifying Homepage Content
2) Implementing Simple Header Shortcuts (News & Events / Locations)
3) Re-organization of Information Gathering - Events Page

## Evaluation & Revision History
In the middle of my prototyping process, I conducted a Cognitive Walkthrough, Impression Test, Accessibiliity Audit, and Usability Test in order to explore the flaws of my prototype and how I could better improve and address the design issues. 

### Cognitive Walkthrough & Impression Test
Both of these processes were very important as they exposed live comments and suggestions that users had made when interacting with my prototype. The main feedback that I received was the ambiguity of buttons. I initially had some text underlined for emphasis, and some were buttons. This made it difficult for the user to understand when something was clickable and when it was not. I, therefore, adjusted this for my final prototype.

### Accessibility Audit
I conducted accessibility checks for color contrast and discovered that the main color scheme that I used was appropriate for all users. The color scheme that I used aligned with UCLA's color branding, specifically its school colors of blue and gold.  The two main color schemes that I tested were Blue foreground and Gold background as well as White foreground and Blue background. The first scheme had one particular issue with acessibility under "normal text." As a result, I ensured that this color scheme was used under large or bolded text. The latter scheme passed the test successfully!

### Usability Test
Lastly, I consulted with a prospective UCLA Library user, a fellow Cognitive Science student at UCLA in order to conduct a usability test. The test provided me further insights for how I could resolve issues regarding what was intuitive in my design as well as some of the simple interaction problems arose as I used Figma for the first time.

## Pitch

## Conclusion
I learned so much valuable information from pursuing this project, specifically how valuable the user is in user-centred design. To say that design is a process is an understatement after I truly discovered what it means to be "iterative." Throughout this project, I started to understand the value of user research and understanding what the user really wants because the designer doesn't see things the same way the user does. In addition, it's always very valuable to refer back to user research in order to specifically design for that purpose. Often times, I found myself wanting to re-design the entire website during the prototyping process, but held myself back in order to truly improve usability of the tasks themselves. Nonetheless, it was a very valuable process and I learned a lot about design, research, and implementation of UI and UX.
